# Rally Project Overview

The Rally project is a multi-layered application designed for managing SignBases, equipment, and training sessions. It employs a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. This structure enhances scalability, maintainability, and allows for the application to evolve over time with minimal impact on existing code.

## Architecture and Layer Interaction

### Rally.Api

Serves as the entry point for HTTP requests, delegating operations to the Application layer. It's configured in [src/Rally.Api/Program.cs](src/Rally.Api/Program.cs), where services like Swagger for API documentation are set up.

### Rally.Application

Contains business logic and application services. It acts as a mediator between the API and Infrastructure layers, orchestrating the flow of data and operations. Services in this layer, such as [SignBaseService](file:///Users/trygvebechsgaard/Repoes/Project-Team7-Semester3/README.md#15%2C196-15%2C196) and [EquipmentService](file:///Users/trygvebechsgaard/Repoes/Project-Team7-Semester3/README.md#15%2C347-15%2C347), utilize interfaces defined in the Core layer to interact with data.

### Rally.Core

Defines domain models, interfaces for repositories, and specifications for queries. This layer encapsulates the business rules and serves as a contract for data operations, ensuring the application's business logic is abstracted from its data source.

### Rally.Infrastructure

Implements interfaces from the Core layer, providing concrete data access logic using Entity Framework Core. It interacts with the database and executes operations defined by the Application layer.

## Design Patterns and Methodologies

-   **Specification Pattern**: Used in the Core layer for building dynamic queries based on business rules. Implemented in `BaseSpecification<T>`.

-   **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic, allowing the Application layer to interact with data sources through interfaces.

-   **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Achieves loose coupling between classes and their dependencies, configured in the [Program.cs] files of the API and Web projects.

-   **AutoMapper**: Facilitates object mapping between domain entities and DTOs, reducing boilerplate code for transforming data between layers.

-   **Entity Framework Core**: Provides ORM support, simplifying data access and manipulation through LINQ queries and strongly typed models.

## Conclusion

The Rally project's architecture promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and flexibility. By employing design patterns and methodologies like Specification, Repository, and Dependency Injection, it ensures that the application remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend or modify. This structure not only facilitates development and testing but also aligns with modern software design principles.

# Understanding the Core Layer in Rally.Core

The `Rally.Core` project is a core component of the Rally application, structured to support the domain-driven design (DDD) principles. It is built using C# and targets the .NET 8.0 framework, as specified in the [Rally.Core.csproj](file:///Users/trygvebechsgaard/Repoes/Project-Team7-Semester3/src/Rally.Core/Rally.Core.csproj#1%2C1-1%2C1) file.

```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Rally.Core.csproj
3|  <PropertyGroup>
4|    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

### Key Components

#### Entities

Entities are the domain objects that are identified by their identity. They are located under the `Entities` folder. Each entity inherits from the `Entity` base class, which in turn inherits from `EntityBase<TId>`, providing a generic ID property and methods for entity comparison.

-   **Base Entity**: Abstract class providing ID and equality comparison.

    ```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Entities/Base/Entity.cs
    3|    public abstract class Entity : EntityBase<int>
    ```

-   **Concrete Entities**: Examples include `Track`, `SignBase`, `Category`, `Sign`, and `EquipmentBase`. These classes define specific properties and relationships relevant to the domain.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Entities/Track.cs
    9|    public class Track : Entity
    ```

#### Repositories

Repositories abstract the logic required to access data sources. The `IRepository<T>` interface defines common operations such as `GetAllAsync`, `AddAsync`, and `DeleteAsync`. Concrete repository interfaces for domain entities like `ITrackRepository`, `ISignBaseRepository`, etc., extend this base interface without adding additional methods, indicating adherence to the repository pattern with a focus on domain types.

```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Repositories/Base/IRepository.cs
11|    public interface IRepository<T> where T : Entity
```

#### Specifications

Specifications are used to encapsulate query logic. The `BaseSpecification<T>` class allows for the construction of complex queries using criteria, includes (eager loading), and ordering. This pattern is particularly useful for abstracting query logic out of the repository layer.

```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Specifications/Base/BaseSpecification.cs
8|    public abstract class BaseSpecification<T> : ISpecification<T>
```

#### Interfaces and Helper Classes

-   **IAppLogger<T>**: Interface for application-wide logging.

    ```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Interfaces/IAppLogger.cs
    8|    public interface IAppLogger<T>
    ```

-   **EntityBase and IEntityBase**: Provide foundational functionality for entities, including ID management and equality checks.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Core/Entities/Base/IEntityBase.cs
    3|    public interface IEntityBase<TId>
    ```

### Summary

The `Rally.Core` project is structured to support clean architecture principles, separating concerns into entities, repositories, specifications, and value objects. This setup facilitates maintainability, scalability, and the ability to unit test domain logic effectively.

# Understanding the Infrastructure Layer in Rally.Infrastructure

The Infrastructure layer in the `Rally.Infrastructure` project plays a crucial role in the application's architecture. It acts as the bridge between the application's core logic and the data sources, ensuring that data is correctly managed, queried, and persisted. This layer implements the repository pattern, exception handling, and entity configurations, among other responsibilities.

## Key Components

### Repositories

Repositories are used to abstract the logic required to access data sources. They implement the interfaces defined in the core project (`Rally.Core.Repositories`) and use Entity Framework Core for data access.

-   **Repository Base Class**: Provides common CRUD operations.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Infrastructure/Repositories/Base/Repository.cs
    public class Repository<T> : IRepository<T> where T : Entity
    ```
-   **Specific Repositories**: Extend the base repository to include operations specific to an entity.
    -   `SignBaseRepository`: Manages `SignBase` entities.
        ```csharp:src/Rally.Infrastructure/Repositories/SignBaseRepository.cs
        public class SignBaseRepository : Repository<SignBase>, ISignBaseRepository
        ```
    -   Similar repositories exist for `Category`, `Equipment`, `Sign`, `Track`, and `EquipmentBase`.

### Specifications

Specifications are used to encapsulate the logic for querying entities from the database, allowing for more complex queries.

### Data Context (`RallyContext`)

The `RallyContext` class extends `DbContext` and is responsible for configuring the models and their relationships.

-   **Configuration**: Entity configurations are defined using the Fluent API.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Infrastructure/Data/RallyContext.cs
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    ```

### Migrations

Migrations manage changes to the database schema. They are automatically generated based on model configurations.

### Exceptions

Custom exceptions handle domain-specific errors.

-   `InfrastructureException`: Used across the repository layer to indicate issues related to infrastructure operations.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Infrastructure/Exceptions/InfrastructureException.cs
    public class InfrastructureException : Exception
    ```

## Patterns and Methodologies

### Repository Pattern

The repository pattern is extensively used to decouple the application's core logic from the data access logic. This pattern allows for easier testing and maintenance.

### Specification Pattern

The specification pattern is used for building complex queries over entities. This pattern enables the application to specify the criteria for selecting entities directly in the business logic, keeping queries maintainable and reusable.

### Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is utilized to decouple class dependencies. The Infrastructure layer's services (e.g., repositories) are registered in the DI container and injected into consumers, such as application services.

### Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core is used as the ORM for data access. It provides the underlying mechanism for querying and manipulating data based on the entity configurations and migrations.

## Conclusion

The `Rally.Infrastructure` project encapsulates data access and persistence concerns, leveraging patterns like Repository and Specification to maintain a clean separation of concerns and promote maintainability. Understanding these components and their interactions is crucial for working effectively with the Infrastructure layer.

# Understanding the Application Layer in Rally.Application

The Application layer in the `Rally.Application` project serves as the intermediary between the user interface and the infrastructure/data access layers. It encapsulates the business logic of the application, orchestrating the flow of data to and from the domain entities and translating between domain and data transfer objects (DTOs).

## Key Components

### Services

Services in the Application layer handle the core business operations. They interact with repositories to fetch, manipulate, and store domain entities, ensuring business rules are adhered to.

-   **Base Service**: Provides common functionality such as CRUD operations that can be inherited by specific services.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Services/Base/Service.cs
    public class Service<TDto, TEntity> : IService<TDto, TEntity>
    ```
-   **Specific Services**: Implement business logic specific to domain entities.
    -   `SignBaseService`: Manages operations related to `SignBase` entities.
        ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Services/SignBaseService.cs
        public class SignBaseService : Service<SignBaseDto, SignBase>, ISignBaseService
        ```

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

DTOs are used to transfer data between the application layer and the client. They are typically stripped-down versions of domain entities, containing only the data required by the client.

-   **SignBaseDto**: Represents data related to an SignBase.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Dto/SignBaseDto.cs
    public class SignBaseDto : BaseDto
    ```

### Interfaces

Interfaces define contracts for services, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and facilitating dependency injection.

-   **ISignBaseService**: Defines operations available for `SignBase` entities.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Interfaces/ISignBaseService.cs
    public interface ISignBaseService : IService<SignBaseDto, SignBase>
    ```

### Mappers

Mappers translate between domain entities and DTOs, simplifying the conversion process and reducing boilerplate code.

-   **RallyDtoMapper**: Configures mappings between entities and DTOs.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Mapper/RallyDtoMapper.cs
    public class RallyDtoMapper : Profile
    ```

## Patterns and Methodologies

In the `Rally.Application` project, several design patterns and methodologies are employed to enhance the architecture, maintainability, and scalability of the application. Here's a detailed look at specific patterns and where they have been used:

### Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is a core aspect of the `Rally.Application` layer, facilitating loose coupling between classes and their dependencies. It is used throughout the services to inject dependencies such as repositories and other services. This pattern is evident in the constructors of services where dependencies are passed in, allowing for easier testing and maintenance.

-   **Usage Example**: In [SignBaseService](file:///Users/trygvebechsgaard/Repoes/Project-Team7-Semester3/README.md#14%2C196-14%2C196), the [ISignBaseRepository](file:///Users/trygvebechsgaard/Repoes/Project-Team7-Semester3/README.md#74%2C254-74%2C254) is injected through the constructor, enabling the service to access repository methods without being tightly coupled to the implementation details.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Services/SignBaseService.cs
    public SignBaseService(IRepository<SignBase> repository, ISignBaseRepository SignBaseRepository) : base(repository)
    {
        _SignBaseRepository = SignBaseRepository ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(SignBaseRepository));
    }
    ```

### Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is used to abstract the logic of accessing data sources, making the application layer code more maintainable and decoupled from the data access logic. While the implementation of repositories resides in the `Rally.Infrastructure` layer, the application layer consumes these repositories, adhering to the abstraction principle.

-   **Usage Example**: `SignBaseService` uses `ISignBaseRepository` to interact with the data layer without needing to know about the underlying database or ORM being used.

### AutoMapper

AutoMapper is utilized to map data between domain entities and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). This reduces the amount of boilerplate code required for transforming objects and ensures that the service layer can efficiently pass data to and from the presentation layer and the data access layer.

-   **Usage Example**: In `SignBaseService`, AutoMapper is used to convert `SignBase` entities to `SignBaseDto` objects and vice versa. This simplifies the code and reduces the potential for mapping errors.
    ```csharp:src/Rally.Application/Services/SignBaseService.cs
    var mappedSignBase = ObjectMapper.Mapper.Map<SignBaseDto>(SignBase);
    ```

### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern reduces direct communication between objects, making them communicate indirectly through a mediator object. This pattern can be used in the application layer to orchestrate operations between different services and repositories, reducing coupling and enhancing the flexibility of the code.

### Service Layer Pattern

The Service Layer pattern is a design pattern that applies business logic and transformations between the presentation layer and the data access layer. In `Rally.Application`, this pattern is evident in how services like `SignBaseService`, `CategoryService`, and `EquipmentBaseService` encapsulate the application's business logic, acting as a mediator between the UI and the database.

Each of these patterns contributes to the overall design and architecture of the `Rally.Application` project, ensuring that the code is clean, maintainable, and scalable. By adhering to these patterns, the application facilitates a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and evolve over time.

## Conclusion

The `Rally.Application` project centralizes business logic, serving as a bridge between the user interface and the underlying data. By employing design patterns and methodologies like DI and AutoMapper, it ensures that the application remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend or modify. Understanding the role of services, DTOs, and their interactions is key to developing and maintaining the application's functionality.
